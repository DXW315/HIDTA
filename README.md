# HIDTA

## Traffic Network
This experiment is conducted on multiple networks of increasing complexity (Sioux Falls, Chicago, and Anaheim). The city road network data is sourced from (https://github.com/bstabler/TransportationNetworks).  

The DTALITE is sourced from https://github.com/xzhou99/Dtalite_NeXTA_package


## Experiments

The experiments compared with the Baseline were conducted using DTAlite software, while the Baseline comes from the paper "Heterogeneous Graph Sequence Neural Networks for Dynamic Traffic Assignment". 
Ablation experiments and parameter analysis were performed on SUMO.
